# Intuit Auto POC - yarn

## Description

Similar to the initial POC (see it [here](https://github.com/bguillen-tcs/auto-poc)), but with two differences.

1. Simpler: It only has one package, `components`
2. `yarn`: As the name implies, it was used to test how `auto` would work if using `yarn`, rather than `lerna` for the monorepo.

Again, given the similarities between this and the original POC linked above, check that `README.md` for more detail.

The key takeaway for this experiment is: Doesn't seem like it works!  I reached out to the team to their dev team to see if what I am trying to do without `lerna` works.  See the comment [here](https://github.com/intuit/auto/discussions/1861#discussioncomment-1880244).
